# surfs_up

## Overview:
An investor wants to learn more about the weather before committing to build a surfs shop that will serve also ice cream in Oahu, Hawaii. The investors main concern is the weather and how this can have a positive or negative effect in his investment. For that purpose, we gather data from SQlite data source and used tools like Jupyter notebook to run python coding language and create statistical analysis. 

## Results:

These two images tell us about the differing weather patterns for the two monthly periods. Some takeaways:

1: the Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, although we are only looking at the average temperatures, we can guess that year round temperatures fluctioation is not significant in the island. 

2: the maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also very much similar which show how concistent the weather in the island can be.

3: the biggest difference we see in the results comes from the minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June). With lower temperature level in December than in june. This could mean that although year round the business might still make profits, december is looking like it would have a smaller take in profits than months closer to june. Looking at the standard deviation 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December) the data in december seems to be more spread out from its mean.

4: if we look at the quartile data, we can assume that the max and min temperatures of both months are outliers. Since most data points fall within the 25% & 75%  and they are close to their corresponding means. 

## Summary:

in summary and after analyzing this data so far there is no reason to believe the shop will not do good in Oahu. Temperatures seem to be very consistent on the island, which means that patterns are more easily identify, which can lead to better business planning for the owner. although December might be a bit more of colder month our data shows that it should not be much of a concern. We have evaluated the data and run analysis on temperatures, however we did not account for other weather conditions that we might be able to run analysis on like precipitation and wind conditions. since precipitation can have negative impact on sales as well as wind condition or speed.
